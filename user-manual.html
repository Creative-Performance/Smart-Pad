    <h2 id="introduction">1.0 Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to the user manual for the <strong>Smart Drum Practice Pad</strong>, created by the <em>Creative Performance Labs</em> student engineering team. The prototype we developed is an enhanced drum practice pad capable of measuring the force of strikes and displaying that data visually via a companion app.
</p>
<p>
  Powered by rechargeable batteries, the pad is portable and can be used anywhere—just bring drumsticks and a mobile device. Bluetooth connectivity enables wireless pairing with the app, which was fully developed by one of the team members.
</p>
<p>
  Once connected, the app displays force feedback using a force vs. time graph. Users can save, share, or delete session data as needed. Additionally, the app includes a built-in metronome that supports a tempo range of 0–240 BPM.
</p>
<p>
  This manual will guide you through the setup, operation, and best practices for optimal performance. If you need help, check the <a href="#faq">FAQs</a> section. Still stuck? Don’t hesitate to contact one of our five team members listed in the <a href="#support">Support</a> section.

    <h2 id="tips">4.0 Operational Tips</h2>

<p>To ensure optimal performance of the smart drum practice pad, please follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ONLY operate the pad indoors</strong>, or if necessary, outdoors in <em>sunny weather only</em>. The electronics are sensitive to moisture and can be damaged by rain, snow, or humidity.</li>

  <li><strong>ONLY place the pad on a surface with an elevation of fifteen degrees or more.</strong> Avoid large elevation angles that could cause the pad to slide. Due to its weight, a fall can cause serious, irreparable damage.</li>

  <li><strong>ONLY clean the striking material using a dry or slightly damp cloth</strong>. Be gentle and ensure the pad is powered off first. You may use a small amount of dish soap, but do <u>not</u> use harsh chemicals. The cloth should not be soaked—if water is used, wring it out before wiping. Always dry the rubber before resuming operation.</li>
</ul>


    <h2 id="faq">5.0 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<div>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I make the feedback graph any larger?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can. There are two ways in which you can enlarge the graph:
    <ol>
      <li>Rotate your electronic device to horizontal orientation. The app will adapt and enlarge the force vs. time graph.</li>
      <li>Press on the graph to open a larger pop-up display. To exit, tap anywhere on the screen.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the maximum tempo at which I can play so that the pad will be able to generate feedback for?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> The force sensors within the drum pad can process force readings up to a maximum of 16th notes at 160 BPM.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How much practice session data can I save in the app?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> At least 2 hours of data can be saved on any mobile device. Maximum storage depends on device capacity. New phones with ample space can store more sessions than older, nearly full devices.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can the pad help me tell if I am weaker in one hand?</p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Strike the pad once with each hand, starting with your dominant hand. The first peak on the graph shows the force of the first strike; the second peak shows the second. A significantly smaller second peak indicates your non-dominant hand is weaker. To monitor progress, continue alternating hands—if every second peak remains lower, your non-dominant hand still needs strengthening.</p>
